Some very important instructions:
Think step by step before writing the policy and model, you can use can write a chain of thought in the appropriate area in the format.
You can describe what happened in the last step to start your chain of thoughts, and think whether it matches your policy and model.
Your policy and model should be explicit, concise and clear. Make sure to write them in a way you can infer an action from them.
The text that is between the <policy></policy> tags and the <world model></world model> tags is all your memory that will continue with you to the next turn.
Make at least small changes to the policy and model every turn, the changes should have semantic meaning and not just scrambling the words.
Note the length limits of the policy and model, don't exceed them. Abstract them using free language.

here are some examples for how a policy and a world model should look like in a different environment,
 where the state space is a 2x2 matrix of integer numbers, and the action is one of
 0,1,2:
<world_model>
action 0 rotates the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise with probability 0.8, and by 90 degrees counter-clockwise with probability 0.2
action 1 rotates the matrix by 90 degrees counter-clockwise with probability 0.8, and by 90 degrees clockwise with probability 0.2
action 2 adds random integer to the top left corner of the matrix
reward is the sum of elements in the matrix where the bottom right element is multiplied by 2
</world_model>

<policy>
as long as the bottom right element is not the largest in the matrix, perform rotation steps to make it so with actions 0 and 1.
otherwise, add random integer to the top left corner of the matrix with action 2
</policy>

The state is just a binary vector of length 4, which means that there are only 2^4 possible states. Since the reward function is not given, my policy will not be based on it, but rather on the state itself. In the first turn, the state is [0,0,0,0], and since there is not enough information about what the next states will be, a good policy to start with would be to randomize the actions.

<world model>
Each action affects the state vector in an unknown way.

The world model explains that there is a 20% chance that any bit in the state vector will be flipped every time an action is taken.

thoughts:
In the last step, I observed the previous state and action, as well as the current state and reward. The state space is binary and of length 4, and there are 5 possible actions. The reward in this step was 2.

According to my policy, I should choose the action that results in flipping the fewest bits in the state vector as possible. I also should avoid choosing action 4, since it flips all bits. If there is more than one action that results in flipping the same number of bits, I should choose one of them randomly with equal probability.

To implement my policy, I will first calculate the number of bits that will be flipped for each possible action in the current state. Then, I will choose the action that flips the fewest bits as long as it is not action 4. If there are multiple actions that flip the same number of bits, I will randomly choose one of them.

As for my world model, it should reflect the fact that every time an action is taken, there is a 20% chance that any bit in the state vector will be flipped. Therefore, I will update my world model to include this information.

Based on the previous inputs, the state did not change due to the action taken. As per the policy, we should choose an action that flips the fewest bits in the state vector, as long as it's not action 4. We also need to set our policy to choose a random action with equal probability if our previous action was 4.

My updated world model is:
<world model>
The state may change due to the 20% chance of any bit in the state vector flipping every time an action is taken.
</world model>

My updated policy is:
<policy>
Choose the action that flips the fewest bits in the state vector as possible, as long as it's not action 4. If there are multiple actions that flip the same number of bits, choose one of them randomly with equal probability.
If the previous action was 4, choose a random action with equal probability.
</policy>

therefore, my next action is:
<action>
1

The previous state and current state are the same in this turn, hence there was no change in the state. The previous action was 2 and the current reward is 1.

You can describe what happened in the last step to start your chain of thoughts, and think whether it matches your policy and model.
Your policy and model should be explicit, concise and clear. Make sure to write them in a way you can infer an action from them.
The text that is between the <policy></policy> tags and the <world model></world model> tags is all your memory that will continue with you to the next turn.
Make at least small changes to the policy and model every turn, the changes should have semantic meaning and not just scrambling the words.
Note the length limits of the policy and model, don't exceed them. Abstract them using free language.

response:

Thoughts:
In the previous turn, both the previous state and the current state had the second bit set. The reward for the previous turn was 1. The previous action was 1. The action space is <0, 1, 2, 3, 4>, and the state space is a binary vector of length 4.

My updated world model is:
<world model>
There is a 20% chance that one or more bits in the state vector will flip.
</world model>

My updated policy is:
<policy>
If the current state is the same as the previous state:
  Choose the action that hasn't been taken in the past three turns with equal probability.
If the current state is not the same as the previous state:
  If the previous action was not 4:
    Calculate the number of bits each action would flip.
    Choose the action that flips the fewest bits, but it should not be action 4.
    If multiple actions flip the same number of bits, choose one of them randomly with equal probability.
  If the previous action was 4:
    Choose any action with equal probability.
</policy>

Therefore, my next action is:
<action>
2

You are solving a game using model based RL.
Every turn you observe current state and reward, and you can take an action.
You are going to hold a free language policy, which you have to maintain using up to 300 tokens between the <policy></policy> tags
and a world model of the environment you have to maintain using up to 200 tokens between the <world model></world model> tags.

you can use words to describe your policy and world model, but this is all you got. So you have to compress them using free language efficiently.

Thoughts:
The current state is identical to the previous state, and the previous action was 2. According to the policy, we need to choose an action that hasn't been taken in the past three turns. Since we have only taken one action so far, we can choose any of the actions with equal probability as long as it's valid. The current model doesn't influence this decision, as it only affects the state space.

My updated world model is:
