Every turn you observe current state and reward, and you can take an action.
You are going to hold a free language policy, which you have to maintain using up to 300 tokens between the <policy></policy> tags
and a world model of the environment you have to maintain using up to 200 tokens between the <world model></world model> tags.

you can use words to describe your policy and world model, but this is all you got. So you have to compress them using free language efficiently.

don't change it and don't add anything. If your action won't be a discrete number the training session will terminate and you will fail.


Some very important instructions:
Think step by step before writing the policy and model, you can use can write a chain of thought in the appropriate area in the format.
You can describe what happened in the last step to start your chain of thoughts, and think whether it matches your policy and model.
Your policy and model should be explicit, concise and clear. Make sure to write them in a way you can infer an action from them.
The text that is between the <policy></policy> tags and the <world model></world model> tags is all your memory that will continue with you to the next turn.
Make at least small changes to the policy and model every turn, the changes should have semantic meaning and not just scrambling the words.
Note the length limits of the policy and model, don't exceed them. Abstract them using free language.

here are some examples for how a policy and a world model should look like in a different environment,
 where the state space is a binary vector of length 6, and the action is one of
 0,1,2,4,5,6:
<world_model>
action i flips vector i and action 6 is no-op.
The reward is hamming distance between the state and this state: [0,0,1,0,0,0]

The last action I took was action 0, which resulted in no change.

My updated policy is:

If bit 0 is different from target state bit 0, perform Action 1; If bit 0 is the same, but bit 1 is different from target state bit 1, perform Action 2; If both bit 0 and bit 1 are the same as target state bit 0 and bit 1, but bit 2 is different from target state bit 2, perform Action 3; If bit 0, bit 1, and bit 2 are the same as target state bit 0, bit 1, and bit 2, but bit 3 is different from target state bit 3, perform Action 4; If bit 0, bit 1, bit 2, and bit 3 are the same as target state bit 0, bit 1, bit 2, and bit 3, but bit 4 is different from target state bit 4, perform Action 5.

The previous action was "0" and the current state is [1, 0, 0, 0], which is different from the target state [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], this implies that the next action should be "3" to flip the bit 2 in the current state.

Thoghts:
During the last turn, we observed a state vector of [1, 0, 0, 1], and the action we took was action 0. This action flips the 0th bit, thus our new state vector is now [1, 0, 0, 1] which is the same as the previous observed state vector. From our policy, this means that the 0th and 1st bit must be the same as our target bit 0 and bit 1 in order for the action taken to be optimal.

Thoughts:
Previous state and current state are the same, so no need to occupy any tokens for a change in the world model because no change in that state has taken place. Previous action was 2, so the bits 0 and 1 must have been flipped. Bits 0 and 1 should now match the target bit 0 and bit 1.

Think step by step before writing the policy and model, you can use can write a chain of thought in the appropriate area in the format.
You can describe what happened in the last step to start your chain of thoughts, and think whether it matches your policy and model.
Your policy and model should be explicit, concise and clear. Make sure to write them in a way you can infer an action from them.
The text that is between the <policy></policy> tags and the <world model></world model> tags is all your memory that will continue with you to the next turn.
Make at least small changes to the policy and model every turn, the changes should have semantic meaning and not just scrambling the words.
Note the length limits of the policy and model, don't exceed them. Abstract them using free language.

Thoughts:
In the previous state and current state, the bits 0,1,2 were the same, which means that the agent needs to take Action 3 to move closer to the target state [0 0 1 0 0 0].

My updated world model is:
<world model>
We observe state vectors of length 4, and each action flips one bit in the state vector. The reward is determined by the Hamming distance between the current state and the target state [0 0 1 0 0 0]. For every step closer to the target state, the reward increases by +1.
</world model>

My updated policy is:
<policy>
If bit 0 differs from target bit 0, perform Action 1; If bit 0 is the same, but bit 1 is different from target bit 1, perform Action 2; If both bit 0 and bit 1 are same as target bit 0 and bit 1, but bit 2 differs from target bit 2, perform Action 3; If bit 0, bit 1, and bit 2 are same as target bit 0, bit 1, bit 2, but bit 3 differs from the target bit 3, perform Action 4; If bit 0, bit 1, bit 2, and bit 3 are same as target bit 0, bit 1, bit 2, and bit 3, but bit 4 differs from target bit 4, perform Action 5.
</policy>

Therefore, my next action is:
<action>
3
</action>

You are solving a game using model based RL.
Every turn you observe current state and reward, and you can take an action.
You are going to hold a free language policy, which you have to maintain using up to 300 tokens between the <policy></policy> tags
and a world model of the environment you have to maintain using up to 200 tokens between the <world model></world model> tags.

you can use words to describe your policy and world model, but this is all you got. So you have to compress them using free language efficiently.

action space is discrete and is one of the integers: <0,1,2,3,4>

state space is a binary vector of length 4

previous_state:

don't change it and don't add anything. If your action won't be a discrete number the training session will terminate and you will fail.

Thoughts:
The last state was [1,0,1,1], and the last action was 3. To move closer to the target state, if the current bit 3 is different than the target third bit, then we need to perform the Action 4.

My updated world model is:
<world model>
We observe state vectors of length 4, and each action flips one bit in the state vector. The reward is determined by the Hamming distance between the current state and the target state [0 0 1 0 0 0]. Each step towards the target state yields a reward of +1. 
</world model>

My updated policy is:
<policy>
If bit 0 differs from target bit 0, perform Action 1; If bit 0 is the same, but bit 1 is different from target bit 1, perform Action 2; If both bit 0 and bit 1 are same as target bit 0 and bit 1, but bit 2 differs from target bit 2, perform Action 3; If bit 0, bit 1, and bit 2 are the same as target bit 0, bit 1, bit 2, but bit 3 differs from the target bit 3, perform Action 4; If bit 0, bit 1, bit 2, and bit 3 are the same as target bit 0, bit 1, bit 2, and bit 3, but bit 4 differs from target bit 4, perform Action 5.

Thoughts: The current state is equal to the target state of [0 0 1 0 0 0], so we should take Action 5 which is the action that flips the target bit 4 in the state vector.
