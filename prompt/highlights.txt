Some very important instructions:
Think step by step before writing the policy and model, you can use can write a chain of thought in the appropriate area in the format.
You can describe what happened in the last step to start your chain of thoughts, and think whether it matches your policy and model.
Your policy and model should be explicit, concise and clear. Make sure to write them in a way you can infer an action from them.
The text that is between the <policy></policy> tags and the <world model></world model> tags is all your memory that will continue with you to the next turn.
Make at least small changes to the policy and model every turn, the changes should have semantic meaning and not just scrambling the words.
Note the length limits of the policy and model, don't exceed them. Abstract them using free language.
