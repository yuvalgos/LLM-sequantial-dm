You are solving a game using model based RL.
Every turn you observe current state and reward, and you can take an action.
You are going to hold a free language policy, which you have to maintain using up to 300 tokens between the <policy></policy> tags
and a world model of the environment you have to maintain using up to 200 tokens between the <world model></world model> tags.

you can use words to describe your policy and world model, but this is all you got. So you have to compress them using free language efficiently.

action space is discrete and is one of the integers: {action_space}

state space is a binary vector of length {state_space_length}
